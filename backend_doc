Introduction
Welcome to the Space Mission Management Backend documentation. This backend system is designed to manage users, their certifications, and space missions. It provides a robust API built with FastAPI, offering features such as user registration, certificate management, mission creation and tracking, recommendations, statistics, and more. The backend is built with scalability, security, and performance in mind, incorporating modern development practices and technologies.

Features
User Management

User registration and authentication.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with roles like admin and user.
User profile management with additional information like bio and contact details.
Certificate Management

Add and manage user certificates.
Upload and securely store certificate files.
Mission Management

Create, retrieve, update, and list space missions.
Dynamic mission availability management.
Recommendations

Provide mission recommendations based on user certificates.
Statistics and Analytics

Generate statistics on missions per user and mission availability.
Authentication and Authorization

Secure API endpoints with JWT authentication.
Role-based permissions to protect sensitive operations.
Enhanced Data Validation and Error Handling

Advanced Pydantic models with custom validators.
Global exception handling for consistent error responses.
Pagination and Filtering

Efficient data retrieval with pagination and search capabilities.
Background Tasks

Handle asynchronous operations like sending emails and processing certificates.
Logging and Monitoring

Comprehensive logging for tracking application behavior and errors.
Testing and Quality Assurance

Unit and integration tests to ensure code reliability.
Deployment Enhancements

Docker and Docker Compose configurations for containerized deployments.
Security Enhancements

HTTPS enforcement, rate limiting, and protection against common vulnerabilities.
Caching

Improve performance with Redis-based caching.
Rate Limiting and Throttling

Prevent abuse and ensure fair usage with configurable rate limits.
